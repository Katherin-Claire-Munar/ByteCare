Disease,
Drug Reaction,"Refers to an adverse response or side effect that occurs after the administration of a medication, ranging from mild symptoms like nausea or drowsiness to severe conditions such as allergic reactions or organ damage."
Malaria,"A mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus. It typically presents with symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications and even death. Treatment involves antimalarial medications and preventive measures such as mosquito control and the use of bed nets."
Allergy,"Is an exaggerated immune response to a substance that is usually harmless to most people. When an allergic individual comes into contact with an allergen, such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or certain foods, their immune system overreacts, leading to various symptoms. These symptoms can range from mild, such as sneezing, itching, or a rash, to severe, including difficulty breathing, swelling, or anaphylaxis. Allergies can be managed through avoidance of triggers, medication, and allergy shots (immunotherapy)."
Hypothyroidism,"Is a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, which fails to produce enough thyroid hormones. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, energy levels, and various bodily functions. Symptoms of hypothyroidism can include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, sensitivity to cold, depression, and sluggishness. The condition is commonly treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy to restore hormone levels and alleviate symptoms. Regular monitoring and medication adjustments may be necessary to maintain optimal thyroid function."
Psoriasis,"A chronic autoimmune skin disorder characterized by the rapid buildup of skin cells, resulting in the formation of thick, red patches with silvery scales. It is caused by an overactive immune system that mistakenly targets healthy skin cells, leading to their accelerated production. Psoriasis commonly affects areas like the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back, but can occur anywhere on the body. The condition is associated with itching, discomfort, and sometimes joint pain. Treatment options include topical creams, oral medications, phototherapy, and biologic injections, aiming to control symptoms, reduce inflammation, and slow down skin cell growth."

Factors such as hormonal changes, excessive oil production, certain medications, and genetics can contribute to acne development. "
Diabetes,"A chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of blood glucose (blood sugar). It occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes."
Impetigo,"Is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection characterized by the presence of red sores or blisters that can break open and form a yellowish-brown crust. It is primarily caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Impetigo commonly affects children, especially in areas with broken skin due to cuts, insect bites, or existing skin conditions."
Hypertension," Also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the arteries. It occurs when the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels is consistently too high. Hypertension is often referred to as the ""silent killer"" because it typically does not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages."
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Is a condition characterized by open sores or ulcers that develop in the lining of the stomach, upper small intestine (duodenum), or esophagus. These ulcers occur when the protective lining of the digestive tract is eroded, allowing stomach acid and digestive juices to irritate the underlying tissue."
Dimorphic hemorrhoids(piles),"Also known as mixed hemorrhoids or mixed piles, refer to a type of hemorrhoids that exhibit characteristics of both internal and external hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the anal or rectal area."

Chicken pox,"Also known as varicella, is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is characterized by a widespread rash of itchy, fluid-filled blisters that form on the skin. Chickenpox is primarily a childhood disease but can affect people of all ages. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person or by direct contact with the fluid from the blisters. "
Cervical spondylosis,"Is a degenerative condition that affects the joints and discs of the cervical spine (neck). It occurs due to the wear and tear of the cartilage and bones in the neck over time, often associated with aging."
Hyperthyroidism,"Is a condition where the thyroid gland becomes overactive, resulting in excessive production of thyroid hormones and causing symptoms such as increased metabolism, weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness."
Urinary tract infection,"(UTI) is an infection that can occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. It is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra."
Varicose veins,"Are enlarged and twisted veins that commonly occur in the legs. They develop when the valves within the veins that help blood flow back to the heart become weak or damaged, causing blood to pool and veins to enlarge. Risk factors for varicose veins include age, family history, prolonged standing or sitting, obesity, and pregnancy."
AIDS,"is a late stage of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. It is a chronic and potentially life-threatening condition that affects the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to various infections and diseases."

Fungal infection,"Also known as a mycosis, is an infection caused by a fungus. Fungi are microorganisms that can live on the skin, nails, and mucous membranes of the body. While some fungi are harmless, others can cause infections, especially when there is an overgrowth or imbalance in the body's natural microbial environment."
Hepatitis C," Is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and can lead to both acute and chronic liver disease. HCV is primarily transmitted through contact with infected blood, such as through sharing needles or equipment for injecting drugs, unsafe medical procedures or transfusions, or less commonly, through sexual contact or from mother to child during childbirth."

Migraines are often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sound, or smells, and can be disabling for the affected individual."
Bronchial Asthma,"Commonly referred to as asthma, is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. It causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. These symptoms occur due to the increased sensitivity and hyperreactivity of the airways to certain triggers."
Alcoholic hepatitis,Is a condition characterized by inflammation and liver damage caused by excessive alcohol consumption over an extended period of time. It is a form of alcoholic liver disease and is typically seen in individuals who engage in heavy or chronic alcohol abuse.
Jaundice,"Is a medical condition characterized by yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. It occurs when there is an excess of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells, in the body."

Dengue fever is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding tendencies, such as nosebleeds or easy bruising."
Hepatitis D,"Also known as delta hepatitis, is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). HDV is an incomplete virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate and cause infection. Hepatitis D can occur either as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection in individuals who are already chronically infected with HBV."
Heart attack,"Occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle. This blockage is usually caused by a clot that forms in one of the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart."
